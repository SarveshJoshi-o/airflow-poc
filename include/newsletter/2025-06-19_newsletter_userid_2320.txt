Hi Lira! 

If you venture outside right now in Oslo, you'll find the temperature to be 20.0°C, but it will feel more like 17.5°C. The relative humidity is 30%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This is what Ripley might say to you today:

When all seems lost, remember, it's in the dark
that the chest bursts forth, illuminating the
night sky with a brilliance that rivals the
northern lights. Hold on, for the beauty of the
by-product awaits.

Have a fantastic journey!
