Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This is what The Doctor might say to you today:

Marcellus, my dear friend, remember that even in
the darkest of times, there's always a new
adventure waiting! The universe has a funny way of
working; you just need to take that leap of faith
and embrace the madness. After all, as someone
once said, "There's no point in being grown up if
you can't be childish sometimes."

Have a fantastic journey!
