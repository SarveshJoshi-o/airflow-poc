Hi Lira! 

If you venture outside right now in Oslo, you'll find the temperature to be 22.1°C, but it will feel more like 19.3°C. The relative humidity is 28%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The purpose of life is the life of purpose." - Robin Sharma
2. "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." - Alexander Pope
3. "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has." - Epictetus

This is what Ripley might say to you today:

"Let the Northern Lights be your guide, Lira. Like
the chestbursting Alien, life's true purpose
emerges from the shadows, illuminating hearts and
minds with a brilliant light. Embrace the wonder,
for the journey ahead is yours to claim."

Have a fantastic journey!
