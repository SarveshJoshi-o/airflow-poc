Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The best answer to anger is silence." - Marcus Aurelius
2. "You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible." - Deepak Chopra
3. "Silence is the great teacher and to learn its lessons you must pay attention to it." - Deepak Chopra

Have a fantastic journey!
