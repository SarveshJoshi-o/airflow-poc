Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "We are all here for some special reason." - Robin Sharma
2. "Embody what you teach, and teach only what you have embodied." - Dan Millman
3. "The right thing to do and the hard thing to do are usually the same." - Steve Maraboli

Have a fantastic journey!
