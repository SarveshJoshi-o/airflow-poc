Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 26.0°C, but it will feel more like 29.0°C. The relative humidity is 71%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

When all seems lost, remember Heiner: "There's no
time like the present to brave new worlds, and for
you, my friend, the sky is not the limit - it's
just the view. Find your wings, and soar!"

Have a fantastic journey!
