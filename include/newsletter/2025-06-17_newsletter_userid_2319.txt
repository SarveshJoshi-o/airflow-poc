As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Life is too important to be taken seriously." - Oscar Wilde
2. "Life is what you make it. Always has been, always will be." - Eleanor Roosevelt
3. "Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing." - Theodore Roosevelt

Have a fantastic journey!
