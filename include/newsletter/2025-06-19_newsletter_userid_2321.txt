Hi Marcellus! 

If you venture outside right now in Valencia, you'll find the temperature to be 29.5°C, but it will feel more like 33.5°C. The relative humidity is 59%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The purpose of life is the life of purpose." - Robin Sharma
2. "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." - Alexander Pope
3. "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has." - Epictetus


-----------
This is what The Doctor might say to you today:

Marcellus, my dear friend, your words ring true,
turning thoughts into wild revolutions!   Life's
adventure lies in the journey, not the
destination. Expect the unexpected, for the
universe has a strange way of rewarding those who
embrace the unknown.   So, embrace your blessings,
and rejoice in the wonders that await!

-----------

Have a fantastic journey!
