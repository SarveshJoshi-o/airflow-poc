Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The greatest miracle is to be alive." - Thich Nhat Hanh
2. "All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. " - Albert Einstein
3. "The face is the mirror of the mind, and eyes without speaking confess the secrets of the heart. " - St. Jerome

Have a fantastic journey!
