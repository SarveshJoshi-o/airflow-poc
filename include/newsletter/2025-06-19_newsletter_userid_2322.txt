Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you can't, you must. If you must, you can." - Tony Robbins
2. "There are no second chances in life, except to feel remorse." - Carlos Ruiz Zafon
3. "We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.  " - Seneca

This is what Motoko Kusanagi might say to you today:

You're not a tank running on gas, Kanoa. Even if
the odds are against you, you've got to keep
goingâ€”there's no other choice. The 96th Protocol
won't stop you if you have the will to act.

Have a fantastic journey!
