Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The best answer to anger is silence." - Marcus Aurelius
2. "You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible." - Deepak Chopra
3. "Silence is the great teacher and to learn its lessons you must pay attention to it." - Deepak Chopra

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, remember your own advice about finding
wings? Well, some people are like the Borg; they
want to assimilate and bring you down. Don't let
their anger stir up your own. Rise above it, and
focus on the infinite possibilities within you.
Silence can be golden, especially in the face of
adversity.

-----------

Have a fantastic journey!
