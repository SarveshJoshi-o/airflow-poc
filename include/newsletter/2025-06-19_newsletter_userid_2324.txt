Hi Cassian! 

If you venture outside right now in Reykjavík, you'll find the temperature to be 10.4°C, but it will feel more like 8.4°C. The relative humidity is 73%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The purpose of life is the life of purpose." - Robin Sharma
2. "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." - Alexander Pope
3. "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has." - Epictetus

This is what Paul Atreides might say to you today:

"The spice flows between worlds, Cassian. Embrace
the unexpected, for it is in the unknown where
true joy awaits. Disappointment is a choice;
instead, let your life's purpose be a beacon,
guiding you across the uncharted sands."

Have a fantastic journey!
