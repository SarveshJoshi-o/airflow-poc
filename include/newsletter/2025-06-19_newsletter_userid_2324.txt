Hi Cassian! 

If you venture outside right now in Reykjavík, you'll find the temperature to be 9.6°C, but it will feel more like 8.1°C. The relative humidity is 76%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This is what Paul Atreides might say to you today:

When your back's against the wall, remember:
there's no other choice but to persist. The spice
flows with those who dare to grasp fate and weave
their own destiny.

Have a fantastic journey!
