Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 27.2°C, but it will feel more like 27.5°C. The relative humidity is 56%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The purpose of life is the life of purpose." - Robin Sharma
2. "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." - Alexander Pope
3. "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has." - Epictetus

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

There's an old saying, 'The needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.' Well,
Heiner, your philosophy on life is a true gift,
helping others find their purpose, their 'wings'
as you say, is a noble purpose indeed. You're like
a Starfleet Captain, guiding others to reach new
heights!

Have a fantastic journey!
