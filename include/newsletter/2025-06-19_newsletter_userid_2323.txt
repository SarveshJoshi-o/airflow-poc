Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you can't, you must. If you must, you can." - Tony Robbins
2. "There are no second chances in life, except to feel remorse." - Carlos Ruiz Zafon
3. "We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.  " - Seneca

This is what Leia Organa might say to you today:

No one's path is ever straight, but that's no
excuse to give up. Remember, 'There's always a
way' - a wise man once said. May the Force be with
you, my dear Anaya!

Have a fantastic journey!
