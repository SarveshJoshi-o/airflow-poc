Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

When all seems lost, remember Heiner: "There's no
time like the present to boldy go where no man has
gone before. Find your wings and soar to new
heights!"

Have a fantastic journey!
