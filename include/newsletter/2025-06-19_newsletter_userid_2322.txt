Hi Kanoa! 

If you venture outside right now in Honolulu, you'll find the temperature to be 24.4°C, but it will feel more like 27.0°C. The relative humidity is 78%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The purpose of life is the life of purpose." - Robin Sharma
2. "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." - Alexander Pope
3. "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has." - Epictetus

This is what Motoko Kusanagi might say to you today:

"The ocean's secrets and dreams of humans; these
things are the fuel that ignite our purposes.
Section 9 taught me to cherish what I have and not
mourn what I don't - a life of purpose."

Have a fantastic journey!
