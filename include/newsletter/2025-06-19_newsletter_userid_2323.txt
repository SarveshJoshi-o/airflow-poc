Hi Anaya! 

If you venture outside right now in Jaipur, you'll find the temperature to be 29.3°C, but it will feel more like 35.6°C. The relative humidity is 80%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The purpose of life is the life of purpose." - Robin Sharma
2. "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." - Alexander Pope
3. "He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has." - Epictetus

This is what Leia Organa might say to you today:

May the Force be with you, always.  It's a wise
rebel who finds purpose in the present, embracing
the joy of the here and now. Embrace the light
within, Anaya, and let it guide you.

Have a fantastic journey!
