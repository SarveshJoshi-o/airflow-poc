Hi Marcellus! 

If you venture outside right now in Valencia, you'll find the temperature to be 29.1°C, but it will feel more like 33.5°C. The relative humidity is 59%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt


-----------
This is what The Doctor might say to you today:

Marcellus, my dear friend, remember that even in
the darkest of times, there's always a new
adventure waiting! The universe has a funny way of
working; you just have to take that leap of faith
and embrace the madness. After all, as the old
saying goes, there's no point waiting for tomorrow
- 'It's bigger on the inside!'

Have a fantastic journey!
