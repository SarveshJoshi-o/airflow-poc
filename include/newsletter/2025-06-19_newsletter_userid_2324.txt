Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you can't, you must. If you must, you can." - Tony Robbins
2. "There are no second chances in life, except to feel remorse." - Carlos Ruiz Zafon
3. "We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.  " - Seneca

This is what Paul Atreides might say to you today:

You may feel the odds are against you, but
remember: 'In the face of impossible choices, we
must find the courage to persevere. There is no
other way.' And don't forget, the spice must flow!

Have a fantastic journey!
