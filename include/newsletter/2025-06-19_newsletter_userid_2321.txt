Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "If you can't, you must. If you must, you can." - Tony Robbins
2. "There are no second chances in life, except to feel remorse." - Carlos Ruiz Zafon
3. "We are always complaining that our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them.  " - Seneca


-----------
This is what The Doctor might say to you today:

You're a bold adventurer, Marcellus. Remember,
there's always a new day, a new chance to embrace.
Your ideas are like the regenerations of a certain
Time Lord: endless possibilities! Don't mourn the
past, embrace the future!

-----------

Have a fantastic journey!
