Hello Cosmic Traveller,

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Be willing to be a beginner every single morning." - Meister Eckhart
2. "Fear, uncertainty, and discomfort are your compasses toward growth." - Celestine Chua
3. "The man who moved the mountain was the one who began carrying away the smallest stones." - Zen Proverb

Have a fantastic journey!
