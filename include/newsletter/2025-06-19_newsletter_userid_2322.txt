Hi Kanoa! 

If you venture outside right now in Honolulu, you'll find the temperature to be 24.8°C, but it will feel more like 27.4°C. The relative humidity is 75%.

As you surf the probablistic waves of existance today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "There's no next time. It's now or never." - Celestine Chua
2. "When you're at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold on." - Theodore Roosevelt
3. "Happiness is not a goal...it's a by-product of a life well lived." - Eleanor Roosevelt

This is what Motoko Kusanagi might say to you today:

"At the edge of the cliff, remember: there's no
coiling back, only the dive. Hold on to your
dreams, Kanoa. They're the beacon in the deep. Now
go dive, and embrace the vastness."   ~ Motoko K.

Have a fantastic journey!
